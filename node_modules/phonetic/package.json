  "readme": "# Phonetic\nGenerates unique, pronounceable names, random and seedable\n\n## Installation\nIn your project folder, type:\n\n\tnpm install phonetic\n\n## Usage\nJust require it...\n\n\tvar phonetic = require('phonetic');\n\nNeed a name?\n\n\tphonetic.generate();\n\t// \"Stratulis\"\n\tphonetic.generate();\n\t// \"Quibapop\"\n\nNeed a shorter name?\n\n\tphonetic.generate({ syllables: 2 });\n\t// \"Neelam\"\n\nNeed to generate the same name based on some user info?\n\n\tphonetic.generate({ seed: '127.0.0.1' })\n\t// \"Pokenoop\"\n\tphonetic.generate({ seed: '127.0.0.1' })\n    // \"Pokenoop\"\n\n## Details\nPhonetic generates a randomized, pronounceable word.  Use it to assign\npronounceable hostnames to your server cluster so you don't have to refer to\nmachines by random letters or numbers, or use it to suggest a unique username\nto your site's visitors.  Keep the name the same every time by seeding it with\na unique cookie, or maybe the user's IP + user agent.\n\nWords are generated by transforming the seed using a series of MD5 hashes and\ncalculations that make it impossible for users to game the system and coerce\nout a chosen word.  The process is synchronous, but takes mere nanoseconds.\n\nGenerated words have an English-leaning format, using phonetics that are more\ncommon in the English language and avoiding more international sounds.  This\ncould be changed by packaging the phonetic sets and replacements into modules\nwhich can be selected through the options at run time.  A hint to those who\nwould like to get involved with the project!\n\nThe function call looks like this:\n\n**phonetic.generate([options])**\n\n### Options\nThe following options are available:\n\n#### syllables\n*Default: 3.* The number of syllables to put in the resulting word.\n\n#### seed\n*Default: (random).* A string or number with which to seed the generator.\nUsing the same seed (with the same other options) will coerce the generator\ninto producing the same word each time.\n\n#### phoneticSimplicity\n*Default: 5.* The greater this number, the simpler the phonetics. For example,\n1 might produce 'str' while 5 might produce 's' for the same syllable.  Minimum\nis 1.\n\n#### compoundSimplicity\n*Default: 5.* The greater this number, the less likely the resulting word will\nsound \"compound\", such as \"ripkuth\" instead of \"riputh\".  Minimum is 1.\n\n#### capFirst\n*Default: true.* true to capitalize the first letter of the word; all lowercase\notherwise.\n\n## License\nPhonetic is distributed under the MIT license.  See LICENSE.txt for details.\n\n## Credits\nPhonetic was created by Tom Frost in 2013 to ease the transition from lurking\nto contributing.\n",
